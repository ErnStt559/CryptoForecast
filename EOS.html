<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As of August 20, 2025, 01:19 AM EEST, EOS, now rebranded to Vaulta (AUSD), is trading at approximately $0.4859 USD, with a market capitalization of around $1.27 billion. Originally launched in 2018 by Block.one, EOS is a decentralized blockchain platform designed for high-performance decentralized applications (dApps) using a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. In March 2025, EOS transitioned to Vaulta, pivoting toward a Web3 banking operating system, aiming to bridge DeFi and traditional finance (TradFi). This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Vaulta’s price outlook for the end of 2025, exploring its market trends, growth drivers, risks, and technical analysis based on current data and projections.</p>

<h2>Current Situation</h2>
<p>Vaulta (EOS) is currently priced at $0.4859, down 0.15% in the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $978,043 USD. The cryptocurrency ranks #3569 by market cap, reflecting a challenging period since its all-time high of $22.89 in April 2018. Over the past year, EOS has declined by 25%, but recent developments, including its rebranding to Vaulta and a $6 million partnership with Worldlibertyfi, signal renewed interest. The Fear and Greed Index at 64 (Greed) suggests broader market optimism, potentially supporting Vaulta’s recovery. Technical indicators show a bearish sentiment, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 30.49, indicating a neutral to oversold market, and the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) projected to rise to $0.6715 by early September 2025.</p>

<h2>Price Predictions for End of 2025</h2>
<p>Price predictions for Vaulta (EOS) by December 2025 vary due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and its recent rebranding. Based on aggregated analyst forecasts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bearish Scenario:</strong> If market adoption of Vaulta’s Web3 banking vision lags or regulatory challenges arise, the price could drop to $0.30–$0.46, aligning with pessimistic projections.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate Scenario:</strong> Most analysts expect Vaulta to trade between $0.51 and $1.00, driven by steady adoption and a broader crypto market rally. CoinPriceForecast predicts $0.90 by year-end, a 28% increase from the current price.</li>
<li><strong>Bullish Scenario:</strong> Optimistic forecasts, fueled by successful rebranding and partnerships, suggest a price of $1.20–$1.60. Analysts at 99Bitcoins see a potential breakout to $1.60 by May 2025, assuming sustained trading volume and market recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer-term projections are more optimistic, with some analysts predicting $2.15 by year-end if Vaulta’s Web3 banking initiatives gain traction. However, reaching $10 is unlikely before 2032 due to significant market cap growth requirements.</p>

<section id="growth-factors">
<h2>Factors Driving Growth</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebranding to Vaulta:</strong> The pivot to a Web3 banking operating system, with partnerships like Worldlibertyfi ($6M commitment), enhances Vaulta’s appeal in DeFi and TradFi integration.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Zero Fees:</strong> Vaulta’s DPoS consensus and zero-transaction-fee model attract dApp developers, with over 600 million transactions processed, boosting ecosystem growth.</li>
<li><strong>Market Rally:</strong> A projected crypto bull run in Q1 2025, driven by Bitcoin and altcoin momentum, could push Vaulta’s price toward $1.00–$1.20.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Chain Integration:</strong> Vaulta’s cross-chain bridge with other DeFi networks enhances interoperability, potentially increasing adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Community Governance:</strong> The EOS Network Foundation’s leadership since 2021 has improved governance, fostering developer and investor confidence.</li>

<section id="risks">
<h2>Risks and Downward Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebranding Challenges:</strong> Confusion from the EOS-to-Vaulta transition or delays in the Web3 banking roadmap could hinder adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Market Competition:</strong> Stronger Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and newer platforms may overshadow Vaulta’s ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risks:</strong> Global regulations targeting DeFi and Web3 could limit Vaulta’s operations or accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Past Controversies:</strong> Historical issues with Block.one’s mismanagement and unfulfilled promises may linger, impacting investor trust.</li>
<li><strong>Bearish Sentiment:</strong> Current technical indicators show bearish pressure, with 33 of 35 signals bearish, potentially capping short-term gains.</li>
</ul>

<section id="volatility">
<h2>Volatility Analysis</h2>
<p>From July to August 2025, Vaulta’s price has shown moderate volatility, with a 6.52% price fluctuation over the past 30 days and a 25% decline over the past year. The RSI at 30.49 suggests a neutral to oversold market, potentially signaling a reversal if buying pressure increases. The 50-day SMA is projected at $0.6003 by early September, indicating short-term resistance, while the 200-day SMA at $0.6715 suggests a longer-term bullish trend. Trading volume has been relatively low at $978,043 daily, but a Q1 2025 market rally could boost liquidity. Posts on X highlight resistance at $6.37 and support at $6.20 for EOSE (likely a typo for EOS), though these levels seem inconsistent with current data and may reflect speculative or unrelated analysis.</p>
