<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Trust Wallet Token (TWT) is the native utility token of Trust Wallet, a popular mobile cryptocurrency wallet launched by Binance in 2020. TWT offers holders in-app benefits, such as discounts on purchases and decentralized exchange (DEX) trades, as well as governance rights within the Trust Wallet ecosystem. As of August 2025, TWT trades at approximately $0.77, with a circulating supply of ~416.65 million tokens and a market capitalization of ~$320 million. This is significantly below its all-time high of $2.72 in December 2022. Trust Wallet supports over 100 blockchains and 10 million+ tokens, boasting over 200 million downloads globally, making it a cornerstone of the crypto wallet space. This analysis explores TWT’s price outlook for 2025, focusing on market trends, growth drivers, risks, competition, adoption, and volatility.</p>[](

<h2>Current Market Context</h2>
<p>In 2025, TWT has underperformed, declining ~12% year-over-year and trading ~70% below its 2022 peak of $2.72. As of late August 2025, it hovers around $0.77 with a 24-hour trading volume of ~$8.57–$14.37 million, representing only ~3.5% of its market cap, indicating low liquidity. Technical indicators are mixed: the 50-day moving average is rising, suggesting short-term bullishness, but the 200-day moving average has been declining since July 2025, signaling longer-term weakness. Volatility over the past 30 days is moderate at ~3.1–5.39%, with 43–57% “green” days. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) ranges between 43–51, indicating neutral momentum. TWT faces resistance at ~$0.80–$0.84 and support at ~$0.70–$0.75, with low trading volumes contributing to price stagnation.</p>[](

<h2>Price Forecasts for End of 2025</h2>
<p>Price predictions for TWT by December 2025 vary across sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bearish Scenario:</strong> Some models predict stagnation or decline, with WalletInvestor forecasting ~$0.658 and AMBCrypto’s AI model suggesting a low of ~$0.61. These scenarios assume continued low liquidity or market downturns.</li>[](
<li><strong>Moderate Scenario:</strong> Most analysts project flat to modest growth. CoinCodex estimates a 2025 range of $0.76–$2.10, averaging ~$1.40 (up to 176% ROI). Binance’s community forecast predicts ~$0.75–$0.77, with limited growth. A consensus range is ~$0.70–$1.10, centering around $0.80–$0.90.</li>[](
<li><strong>Bullish Scenario:</strong> Optimistic forecasts see TWT reaching $1.14–$1.50 if market conditions improve. AMBCrypto suggests a high of ~$1.14, while CoinCodex and CoinMarketCap note potential for $1.37–$1.50 if TWT breaks resistance at $0.84. CCN’s bullish outlook projects up to $2.20, driven by a potential crypto rally.</li>[](
</ul>
<p>Realistic Range: $0.70–$1.10, with a base case of ~$0.90.</p>
</section>
<section id="growth-factors">
<h2>Key Growth Drivers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Massive Wallet Adoption:</strong> Trust Wallet’s 200 million+ downloads and support for 100+ blockchains create a strong user base, driving TWT demand for in-app benefits and governance.</li>[](
<li><strong>Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Utility:</strong> As a BEP-20 token, TWT benefits from BSC’s low fees and fast transactions, making it ideal for staking, swaps, and governance.</li>[](
<li><strong>High Security Standards:</strong> Trust Wallet’s ISO 27001/27701 certifications enhance user trust, supporting long-term adoption.</li>[](
<li><strong>New Utility Features:</strong> The FlexGas feature (paying gas fees with TWT) and tokenized real-world assets (via partnerships like Ondo Finance) increase TWT’s utility, creating buy pressure.</li>[](
<li><strong>Crypto Market Cycles:</strong> A broader market rally, potentially post-Bitcoin halving, could lift TWT, as seen in its 2022 surge to $2.72.</li>[](

<section id="risks">
<h2>Risks and Downside Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> TWT’s thin trading volume (~3.5% of market cap) makes it susceptible to sharp swings, especially in a 30–50% crypto market correction.</li>[](
<li><strong>Regulatory Concerns:</strong> Stricter KYC/AML regulations or restrictions on non-custodial wallets could reduce Trust Wallet’s user base, impacting TWT demand.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Rivals like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet could erode Trust Wallet’s market share if they offer superior features or integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Stalled Adoption:</strong> If Trust Wallet’s growth slows or new features (e.g., FlexGas) fail to gain traction, TWT’s utility and price could stagnate.</li>
<li><strong>Binance Dependency:</strong> TWT’s ties to Binance make it vulnerable to negative developments affecting BSC or Binance, such as regulatory actions or reduced collateral ratios.</li>[](
</ul>
</section>
<section id="volatility">
<h2>Volatility and Technical Outlook</h2>
<p>TWT’s 30-day volatility is moderate at ~3.1–5.39%, with 43–57% “green” days. The RSI (43–51) is neutral, and the price trades near the 50-day SMA ($0.76) but below the 200-day SMA ($0.86), indicating short-term stability but longer-term weakness. Resistance levels at $0.80–$0.84 have capped recent rallies, while support lies at $0.70–$0.75. A breakout above $0.84 could target $1.25–$1.50 in a bullish market, but failure to hold $0.75 may lead to a drop toward $0.60–$0.70. TWT’s price is heavily influenced by broader crypto sentiment and liquidity constraints.</p>[](
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>TWT’s 2025 price is likely to range between $0.70–$1.10, with a base case of ~$0.90. Bullish scenarios (up to $1.50) depend on a crypto market rally and successful feature adoption (e.g., FlexGas). However, risks like volatility, regulatory pressures, and competition from other wallets could keep TWT subdued. Investors should monitor Trust Wallet’s user growth, BSC developments, and market trends while conducting thorough research due to TWT’s high volatility and market dependency.</p>[](
