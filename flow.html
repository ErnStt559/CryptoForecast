<h2>Price Predictions for End of 2025</h2>
<p>Expert projections for Flow’s price in December 2025 differ depending on overall market conditions and ecosystem growth. Bearish expectations point to a possible drop toward $0.35 if an anticipated 30–50% correction occurs in early 2025. More conservative outlooks suggest FLOW stabilizing between $0.65 and $0.90, underpinned by continued adoption across NFTs and gaming. Optimistic estimates see FLOW reaching $1.10–$1.50 if markets recover strongly between February and April 2025. Some analysts believe Flow could hit around $0.85 by October 2025, assuming demand for NFT and gaming projects keeps rising.</p>

<h2>Volatility Analysis</h2>
<p>Between July and August 2025, Flow climbed from $0.45 to $0.55 — a 22% increase — while maintaining 5.2% volatility, showing relative stability compared to prior performance.
