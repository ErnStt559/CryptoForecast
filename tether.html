<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Current Market Situation</h2>
<p>As of August 2025, USDT has a market capitalization of ~$104 billion (circulating supply ~104 billion tokens). Its market share among stablecoins is ~68%, ahead of USDC (~22%). USDT dominates DeFi and exchanges, accounting for ~70% of DEX trades. Tether publishes quarterly reserve attestations, but transparency concerns remain. Core blockchains are Ethereum and Tron, with new integrations on Avalanche, Polkadot, NEAR, and others. coinlaw.io</p>

<section id="key-events">
<h2>Key Events of 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulation:</strong> The GENIUS Act (USA, July 2025) requires 100% backing with liquid assets and monthly reporting. Tether is restructuring reserves, replacing gold with Treasuries. coinlaw.io</li>
<li><strong>Reserves:</strong> Over 90% of the portfolio consists of Treasuries (~$91 billion), ~$5–6 billion in crypto assets. Excess reserves ~ $6.3 billion (2024). coinlaw.io</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Tether discontinued support for Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, Algorand as of September 1, 2025. New networks: Avalanche, Polkadot, NEAR, TON, Celo, Solana. coinmarketcap.com</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory steps:</strong> Tether exited operations under MiCA (EU), losing its license. In the US, transparency has been strengthened under the GENIUS Act. coinmarketcap.com</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="risks">
<h2>Risks and Limiting Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory risks:</strong> Non-compliance with the GENIUS Act or other rules could lead to a US ban on USDT. Loss of license in the EU (MiCA) reduced market coverage. coinmarketcap.com</li>
<li><strong>Reserve transparency:</strong> ~$10 billion in loans and ~$8.9 billion in BTC raise concerns. Semi-annual audits (BDO) are not sufficient for full trust. coinmarketcap.com</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> USDC, FDUSD, DAI/USDS, and CBDCs (digital yuan, euro) threaten USDT’s market share. coinlaw.io</li>
<li><strong>Interest rate risks:</strong> Heavy exposure to Treasuries (~$127 billion) makes Tether vulnerable to interest rate changes and market corrections. coinmarketcap.com</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="scenarios">
<h2>Scenarios for the End of 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining dominance:</strong> Full compliance with the GENIUS Act will strengthen trust. USDT will retain ~60–68% of the market, supporting demand in DeFi and trading. coinmarketcap.com</li>
<li><strong>Loss of confidence:</strong> Issues with reserves or audits could cut USDT’s share below 60%, with outflows toward USDC or CBDCs. coinmarketcap.com</li>
<li><strong>Increased oversight:</strong> Stricter regulations may reduce profitability but improve peg stability. USDT adapts via monthly audits. coinlaw.io</li>
<li><strong>Growing adoption:</strong> Demand for stablecoins in Asia and the Middle East will boost USDT turnover, especially on new blockchains and DeFi. coinlaw.io</li>
</ul>
<p>USDT will remain pegged at ~$1, with possible short-term deviations (±0.5–1%) during market turbulence.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By the end of 2025, Tether (USDT) will remain the leading stablecoin with a capitalization of ~$104 billion and a ~60–68% market share, provided it complies with the GENIUS Act and improves reserve transparency. Key drivers: high demand in DeFi, trading, and new blockchains (Avalanche, TON, Solana). Risks: regulatory restrictions, competition from USDC and CBDCs, and reserve concerns. USDT will maintain its ~$1 peg with minimal deviations. Investors should monitor monthly audits, regulatory updates, and the growth of competing stablecoins.
