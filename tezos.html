<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tezos (XTZ) is a decentralized blockchain platform with a self-amending protocol that uses on-chain governance for upgrades without hard forks. It supports smart contracts, DeFi, NFT, and blockchain gaming, competing with Ethereum and Cardano. The Liquid Proof-of-Stake algorithm allows validators (“bakers”) with 6,000 XTZ and token delegation. Tezos is known for its ICO ($230 million) and NFT ecosystem (Objkt, fxhash). As of late August 2025, XTZ trades around $0.73 with a market cap of ~$768M. coinmarketcap.com</p>
